<<< BAN for iptables/ip6tables >>>

Ban4ip is a lockout tool that reads log files containing fail information and uses iptables/ip6tables to ban IP addresses that persistently cause failures.

Ban4ip is supported IPv4 and IPv6 address.

Previously, I created a lockout tool called Ban4IP.

For all server admins and IPv4 & IPv6 users. :-)


Need Package:

    php
    php-devel
    php-pear
    php-mbstring
    php-pdo (SQLite3/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
    php-process
    php-inotify
    procps


Usage:

Step0. Install (e.g.  CentOS 9 Stream)

dnf -y install php php-devel php-pear php-mbstring php-pdo php-process php-pecl-inotify

wget 'https://github.com/disco-v8/Ban4ip/archive/master.zip' -O Ban4ip-master.zip
unzip ./package/Ban4ip-master.zip

cd ./Ban4ip-master/

chmod 700 ./ban4ipd
chmod 700 ./ban4ipc
chmod 755 ./init.d/ban4ip

mkdir /etc/ban4ip/
mkdir /var/lib/ban4ip/

cp ./ban4ipd.conf /etc/
cp ./ban4ip/* /etc/ban4ip/

cp ./ban4ipc /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4ipd /usr/bin/
cp ./ban4ipd_*.php /usr/bin/

cp ./logrotate.d/ban4ip /etc/logrotate.d/

/bin/cp ./systemd/ban4ip.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl --no-pager -l status ban4ip

systemctl enable ban4ip
systemctl --no-pager -l status ban4ip


Step1. Edit ban4ipd.conf and Sub-config file.

ban4ipd.conf...

YOU CAN UNDERSTAND CONFIG, IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF THIS TOOL. :-)

Sub-config file...
-------------------------------
    :
    :
target_service = 'apache-error'            ... only affects log message.
target_log = '/var/log/httpd/error_log'    ... name of log file.
target_protcol = 'tcp'                     ... BAN protcol. (tcp, udp, all)
target_port = 80                           ... BAN port. (nnn or all)
target_rule = 'DROP'                       ... BAN packet rule. (DROP, REJECT, LOG)

target_str[] = '/error\] \[client (.*)\] client /'        ... (.) is target of BAN.
    :
    :
-------------------------------

"target_str[]" is array parameter. Please write a regular expression..

If you set 'all' to target_protcol and 'target_port', BAN all access from target IP address.


Step2. Start ban4ipd

ban4ipc start

If you changed Sub-config file...

ban4ipc reload

Or ban4ipd.conf...

ban4ipc restart

If you want to know BANs IP address...

ban4ipc list

Other option...

ban4ipc -h


Step 3. Joining the Information Sharing Server (ISS)

Let's Provide the IP address (or network) that Ban4IP/Ban4nft actually banned to the Information Sharing Server (ISS)!

https://www.ban4nft.net/ (*Prepared as of 2024.09.30)

You will register as a USERID with an email address, a password will be sent to that email address.
Next, set “iss_flag” to “1” (=YES) in the configuration file and set ISS-related parameters as needed.
If you BAN some IP address (or Network) one on the server, BAN information is immediately sent to ISS, 
and BAN information provided by other users is imported every 3 minutes.
By sharing BAN information with each other, everyone can be more proactive in their defense.

Have a nice sleep! :-)


Memo:

"Inotify extension not loaded!?", but PECL inotify installed.

 -> pecl search inotify
 -> pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/inotify-3.0.0
 -> And, "extension=inotify.so" write in /etc/php.d/inotify.ini

"PHP Fatal error:  Class 'SQLite3' not found in /root/ban4ip/ban4ipd.php on line 330"

 -> You have to install php-pdo (SQLite3) package.
 
"ban4ipd ... Found other process : /var/run/ban4ip.pid!?"

 -> Illegal termination!? rm /var/run/ban4ip.pid.

"PHP Warning:  SQLite3::exec(): database is locked in ..."

 -> It is so heavy?! extend db_timeout's value in ban4ipd.conf.

"The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached"
"Failed to obtain an inotify instance!?"

 -> Sorry, You should reduce config file. (= target log).

"When using PostgreSQL/MySQL..."

  count_db
  ban_db
  mailrate_db

Create the above three databases. (The tables will be created automatically.)
Then rewrite “pdo_dsn_???” in ban4ipd.conf as needed to enable the setting.
If you have multiple servers on which you want to install “Ban4ip,” you can 
share count_db so that all servers can share fail count information,
which will allow you to quickly respond to lockouts.

Do not share ban_db and mailrate_db, as they must be handled on a per-server basis.
